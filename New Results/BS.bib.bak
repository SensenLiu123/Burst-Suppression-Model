  abstract = {Electroencephalogram (EEG) burst-suppression can be produced with
	several anesthetic agents. Discussions of burst-suppression suggest
	that it has been viewed by many as a relatively uniform physiologic
	state independent of the agent used to produce it. This view may
	be an oversimplification. In this study, relatively deep EEG burst-suppression
	(suppression to burst time ratio, 4:1) was induced in rats with isoflurane
	(I), thiopental (T), etomidate (E), and propofol (P). Burst duration,
	maximum peak-to-peak voltage, area under the curve, and the ratio
	of power in high versus low frequencies of EEG recorded in both cortex
	and subcortex (thalamus) were determined. Analysis of the bursts
	revealed significant differences in duration [I, 1.4 +/- 0.4 (SD);
	T, 0.8 +/- 0.5; E, 0.3 +/- 0.1; P, 0.4 +/- 0.1 seconds], peak-to-peak
	voltage (I, 488 +/- 146; T, 285 +/- 106; E, 310 +/- 87; P, 249 +/-
	50 muV), and area under the curve (I, 111 +/- 24; T, 35 +/- 31; E,
	17 +/- 7; P, 21 +/- 4 muV-s) for all agent pairs except etomidate
	and propofol. Suppression phase analysis revealed considerable residual
	activity with all four agents, although peak-to-peak voltage (I,
	129 +/- 29; T, 64 +/- 20; E, 62 +/- 11; P, 40 +/- 15 muV) and area
	under the curve (I, 73 +/- 17; T, 37 +/- 14; E, 30 +/- 5; P, 22 +/-
	10 muV-s) were greatest with isoflurane. The cortical versus subcortical
	comparison revealed, for all agents, greater peak-to-peak voltage
	and area under the curve in the subcortex. The data indicate that
	the electrophysiologic characteristics of burst-suppression vary
	among the four agents, with the possible exception of etomidate and
	propofol. The data suggest that the neurophysiologic states associated
	with burst-suppression produced by various anesthetics should not
	be assumed to be uniform.},

	drug intoxication. Abnormalities, such as PLEDs or focal continual

	In addition, the EEG may reveal that the alteration in consciousness
	is due to continual epileptic activity without motor manifestations
	(nonconvulsive status) that had not been suspected. As indicated,
	certain patterns have prognostic implications. However, as these
	patterns are not specific for a single etiology, the EEG is of most
	help when the cause is known. For example, burst suppression or a
	diffuse alpha pattern coma can be seen in either hypoxia or a drug
	intoxication. With hypoxia, these patterns carry an extremely poor

	of electrical activity alternate with an isoelectric state. This
	pattern is commonly seen in states of severely reduced brain activity
	such as profound general anesthesia, anoxic brain injuries, hypothermia
	and certain developmental disorders. Devising accurate, reliable

	To conduct dynamic analyses of burst suppression we propose a state-space
	model in which the observation process is a binomial model and the

	an approximate expectation maximization algorithm and illustrate

	unconsciousness, amnesia, analgesia, and immobility along with maintenance
	of physiological stability. General anesthesia has been used in the
	United States for more than 167 years. Now, using systems neuroscience
	paradigms how anesthetics act in the brain and central nervous system
	to create the states of general anesthesia is being understood. Propofol
	is one of the most widely used and the most widely studied anesthetics.
	When administered for general anesthesia or sedation, the electroencephalogram
	(EEG) under propofol shows highly structured, rhythmic activity that
	is strongly associated with changes in the patient's level of arousal.
	These highly structured oscillations lend themselves readily to mathematical
	descriptions using dynamical systems models. We review recent model
	descriptions of the commonly observed EEG patterns associated with
	propofol: paradoxical excitation, strong frontal alpha oscillations,
	anteriorization and burst suppression. Our analysis suggests that
	propofol's actions at GABAergic networks in the cortex, thalamus
	and brainstem induce profound brain dynamics that are one of the
	likely mechanisms through which this anesthetic induces altered arousal
	states from sedation to unconsciousness. Because these dynamical

	found that larger vessels attenuate the myogenic activity of smaller
	vessels and that myogenic responsiveness is sufficient to achieve

  abstract = {The occurrence of so-called four dimensional chaos in dynamical systems
	represented by coupled, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations
	is rarely reported in the literature. In this paper, we present evidence
	that Liley's mesoscopic theory of the electroencephalogram (EEG),
	which has been used to describe brain activity in a variety of clinically
	relevant contexts, possesses a chaotic attractor with a Kaplan-Yorke
	dimension significantly larger than three. This accounts for simple,
	high order chaos for a physiologically admissible parameter set.
	Whilst the Lyapunov spectrum of the attractor has only one positive
	exponent, the contracting dimensions are such that the integer part
	of the Kaplan-Yorke dimension is three, thus giving rise to four
	dimensional chaos. A one-parameter bifurcation analysis with respect
	to the parameter corresponding to extracortical input is conducted,
	with results indicating that the origin of chaos is due to an inverse
	period doubling cascade. Hence, in the vicinity of the high order,
	strange attractor, the model is shown to display intermittent behavior,
	with random alternations between oscillatory and chaotic regimes.
	This phenomenon represents a possible dynamical justification of
	some of the typical features of clinically established EEG traces,
	which can arise in the case of burst suppression in anesthesia and
	epileptic encephalopathies in early infancy.},

  abstract = {Isoflurane is a widely used anesthetic which safely and reversibly
	induces deep coma and associated burst suppression (BS) electroencephalographic
	patterns. Here we investigate possible underlying causes for the
	state of cortical hyperexcitability which was recently shown to be
	one of the characteristics of BS. Our hypothesis was that cortical
	inhibition is diminished during isoflurane-induced BS. Experiments
	were performed in vivo using intracellular recordings of cortical
	neurons to assess their responsiveness to stimulations of connected
	thalamic nuclei. We demonstrate that during BS EPSPs were diminished
	by 44\%, whereas inhibitory potentials were completely suppressed.
	This finding was supported by additional results indicating that
	a decrease in neuronal input resistance normally found during inhibitory
	responses under low isoflurane conditions was abolished in the BS
	condition. Moreover, removal of inhibition occasionally revealed
	excitatory components which were absent during recordings before
	the induction of BS. We also show that the absence of inhibition
	during BS is not caused by a blockage of GABA receptors, since iontophoretically
	applied GABA shows receptor availability. Moreover, the concentration
	of extracellular chloride was increased during BS, as would be expected
	after reduced flow of chloride through GABA(A) receptors. Also inhibitory
	responses were reinstated by selective blockage of glial glutamate
	transporters with dihydrokainate. These results suggest that the
	lack of inhibition during BS is caused by reduced excitation, probably
	resulting from increased glial uptake of glutamate stimulated by
	isoflurane, which creates a diminished activation of cortical interneurons.
	Thus cortical hyperexcitability during BS is favored by suppressed
	inhibition.},

	by reducing the CMRO2 necessary for synaptic transmission while leaving
	the component necessary for cellular metabolism intact. Isoflurane
	may exert a neuroprotective effect by a similar mechanism but its
	efficacy is likely less than that of barbiturates due to adverse
	effects on cerebral blood flow. Lidocaine reduces CMRO2 by affecting
	both cellular metabolic processes and synaptic transmission and thus
	resembles hypothermia in its mechanism of action. Benzodiazepines
	reduce CMRO2 by reducing synaptic transmission and their use as neuroprotectants
	produces less haemodynamic compromise than barbiturates. The mechanism
	of protection by calcium entry blocking agents appears to be due
	to improved blood flow as opposed to altering abnormal Ca++ fluxes.
	In contrast, agents such as ketamine and MK-801 may prevent abnormal

  abstract = {Burst suppression is an electroencephalogram pattern that consists
	of a quasi-periodic alternation between isoelectric 'suppressions'
	lasting seconds or minutes, and high-voltage 'bursts'. It is characteristic
	of a profoundly inactivated brain, occurring in conditions including
	hypothermia, deep general anaesthesia, infant encephalopathy and
	coma. It is also used in neurology as an electrophysiological endpoint
	in pharmacologically induced coma for brain protection after traumatic
	injury and during status epilepticus. Classically, burst suppression
	has been regarded as a 'global' state with synchronous activity throughout
	cortex. This assumption has influenced the clinical use of burst
	suppression as a way to broadly reduce neural activity. However,
	the extent of spatial homogeneity has not been fully explored due
	to the challenges in recording from multiple cortical sites simultaneously.
	The neurophysiological dynamics of large-scale cortical circuits
	during burst suppression are therefore not well understood. To address
	this question, we recorded intracranial electrocorticograms from
	patients who entered burst suppression while receiving propofol general
	anaesthesia. The electrodes were broadly distributed across cortex,
	enabling us to examine both the dynamics of burst suppression within
	local cortical regions and larger-scale network interactions. We
	found that in contrast to previous characterizations, bursts could
	be substantially asynchronous across the cortex. Furthermore, the
	state of burst suppression itself could occur in a limited cortical
	region while other areas exhibited ongoing continuous activity. In
	addition, we found a complex temporal structure within bursts, which
	recapitulated the spectral dynamics of the state preceding burst
	suppression, and evolved throughout the course of a single burst.
	Our observations imply that local cortical dynamics are not homogeneous,
	even during significant brain inactivation. Instead, cortical and,
	implicitly, subcortical circuits express seemingly different sensitivities
	to high doses of anaesthetics that suggest a hierarchy governing
	how the brain enters burst suppression, and emphasize the role of
	local dynamics in what has previously been regarded as a global state.
	These findings suggest a conceptual shift in how neurologists could
	assess the brain function of patients undergoing burst suppression.
	First, analysing spatial variation in burst suppression could provide
	insight into the circuit dysfunction underlying a given pathology,
	and could improve monitoring of medically-induced coma. Second, analysing
	the temporal dynamics within a burst could help assess the underlying
	brain state. This approach could be explored as a prognostic tool
	for recovery from coma, and for guiding treatment of status epilepticus.
	Overall, these results suggest new research directions and methods
	that could improve patient monitoring in clinical practice.},

	Burst suppression, in which bursts of electrical activity alternate

	This pattern is commonly maintained when anesthetics are administered

	clinical implications of burst suppression have been studied extensively,
	the physiological mechanisms underlying its emergence remain unresolved

  abstract = {Burst suppression is an inactivated brain state in which the electroencephalogram
	is characterized by intermittent periods of isoelectric quiescence.
	Recent modeling studies have suggested an important role for brain
	metabolic processes in governing the very slow time scales that underlie
	the duration of bursts and suppressions. In these models, a reduction
	in metabolism leads to substrate depletion and consequent suppression
	of action potential firing. Such a mechanism accounts for the appearance
	of burst suppression when metabolism is directly downregulated. However,
	in many cases such as general anesthesia, metabolic downregulation
	occurs in part as a homeostatic consequence of reduced neuronal activity.
	Here, we develop a mean-field model for neuronal activity with metabolic
	homeostatic mechanisms. We show that with such mechanisms, a simple
	reduction in neuronal activity due, for example, to increased neuronal
	inhibition, will give rise to bistability due to a bifurcation in
	the combined neuronal and metabolic dynamics. The model reconciles
	a purely metabolic mechanism for burst suppression with one that
	includes important dynamical feedback from the neuronal activity
	itself. The resulting fast-slow dynamical description forms a useful

	shifts, using epicranial, epidural, epicortical, intraventricular,
	and intraparenchymal (intraneuronal, intraglial, and field) recordings
	in ketamine-xylazine-anesthetized cats. DC shifts were elicited by
	changes in artificial ventilation, causing end-tidal CO(2) variations
	within a 2-5\% range. Hypercapnia was consistently associated with
	negative scalp DC shifts (average shift -284.4 microV/CO(2)\%, range
	-216 to -324 microV/CO(2)\%), whereas hypocapnia induced positive
	scalp DC shifts (average shift 307.8 microV/CO(2)\%, range 234 to
	342 microV/CO(2)\%) in all electrodes referenced versus the nasium
	bone. The former condition markedly increased intracranial pressure
	(ICP), whereas the latter only slightly reduced ICP. Breakdown of
	the blood-brain barrier (BBB) resulted in a positive DC shift and
	drastically reduced subsequent DC responses to hypo-/hypercapnia.
	Thiopental and isoflurane also elicited a dose-dependent positive
	DC shift and, at higher doses, hypo-/hypercapnia responses displayed
	reverted polarity. As to the possible implication of neurons in the
	production of DC shifts, no polarity reversal was recorded between
	scalp, various intracortical layers, and deep brain structures. Moreover,
	the membrane potential of neurons and glia did not show either significant
	or systematic variations in association with the scalp-recorded CO(2)-dependent
	DC shifts. Pathological activities of neurons during spike-wave seizures
	produced DC shifts of significantly smaller amplitude than those
	generated by hyper-/hypocapnia. DC shifts were still elicited when
	neuronal circuits were silent during anesthesia-induced burst-suppression
	patterns. We suggest that potentials generated by the BBB are the
	major source of epicortical/cranial DC shifts recorded under conditions
	affecting brain pH and/or cerebral blood flow.},

  number = {9},
  abstract = {PURPOSE:
	
	The effect of isoflurane on the subcortical P14 component of the median
	nerve somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) is poorly known. We studied
	whether the P14 wave from the upper brainstem, recorded with a nasopharyngeal
	electrode, was attenuated at the isoflurane-induced EEG burst-suppression
	level. We also compared the effect of isoflurane on the P14, cervical
	N13 and cortical N20, N35 and N6, components.
	
	METHODS:
	
	Seventeen elective patients were anaesthetized with isoflurane. Somatosensory
	evoked potentials were recorded prior to anaesthesia, at 0.5 MAC
	and 1 MAC end-tidal isoflurane as well as at the level when EEG was
	in burst-suppression (mean 1.9 vol% end-tidal isoflurane).
	
	RESULTS:
	
	Isoflurane had varying effects on the subcortical components of median
	SEP. The amplitude of nasopharyngeal P14 was stable, but the mean
	latency increased from 14.4 +/- 1.2 msec at 0.5 MAC to 15.2 +/- 1.1
	msec at burst-suppression level (P < 0.05). In contrast, the N13
	neck response amplitude was attenuated from 3.3 +/- 0.6 microV to
	2.6 +/- 0.5 microV (P < 0.005) without latency changes. The latency
	of the cortical N20 wave was increased from 19.7 +/- 1.1 msec at
	awake to 24.4 +/- 1.6 msec at burst-suppression level (P < 0.0001)
	and amplitude was reduced from 3.3 +/- 1.1 microV to 1.3 +/- 0.6
	microV (P < 0.0001). The later cortical components were attenuated
	even during 0.5 MAC isoflurane and were not recordable during EEG
	burst-suppression.
	
	CONCLUSION:
	
	We conclude that P14 can reliably be recorded with nasopharyngeal
	electrodes during isoflurane anaesthesia, even during EEG burst-suppression,
	when the N20 wave is attenuated. In contrast, the middle-latency
	SEP components are sensitive to isoflurane anaesthesia.},

	for their potential to protect the brain from ischemic injury. While

	culture models of ischemia/reperfusion injury in vitro, the mechanism
	of protection is not well understood. Protein aggregation is part
	of the etiology of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's
	and Alzheimer's, and recent data demonstrate protein aggregates in
	animal models of stroke. We now demonstrate that overexpression of
	Hsp70 in hippocampal CA1 neurons reduces evidence of protein aggregation
	under conditions where neuronal survival is increased. We have also
	demonstrated protection by the cochaperone Hdj-2 in vitro and demonstrated
	that this is associated with reduced protein aggregation identified
	by ubiquitin immunostaining. Hdj-2 can prevent protein aggregate
	formation by itself, but can only facilitate protein folding in conjunction
	with Hsp70. Pharmacological induction of Hsp70 was found to reduce
	both apoptotic and necrotic astrocyte death induced by glucose deprivation
	or oxygen glucose deprivation. Protection from ischemia and ischemia-like
	injury by chaperones thus involves at least anti-apoptotic, anti-necrotic

  abstract = {This experimental study on anesthetized cats used intracellular recordings
	of cortical, thalamocortical and reticular thalamic neurons (n =
	54), as well as multi-site extracellular recordings (n = 36), to
	investigate the cellular correlates of EEG burst-suppression patterns,
	defined as alternating wave bursts and periods of electrical silence.
	Burst-suppression was elicited by the administration of the same
	or other anesthetic agents upon the background of an already synchronized
	EEG activity. About 95\% of cortical cells entered burst-suppression,
	in close time-relation with EEG activity, displaying sequences of
	phasic depolarizing events associated with bursts of EEG waves and
	an electrical silence of the neuronal membrane during flat EEG epochs.
	The membrane potential (Vm) hyperpolarized by approximately 10 mV
	prior to any EEG change and the slow rhythms reflecting deep stages
	of anesthesia progressively disorganized with transition to burst-suppression.
	During flat EEG epochs, the apparent input resistance (tested through
	short hyperpolarizing current pulses) decreased (range 12-60\%) and
	neuronal responsiveness to orthodromic volleys (tested by thalamic
	and cortical evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials) was dramatically
	reduced. It is proposed that the decreased input resistance is mainly
	due to an increase in K+ conductances. At variance with cortical
	neurons, only 60-70\% of thalamic cells ceased firing before overt
	EEG burst-suppression and were completely silent during flat periods
	of EEG activity. The remaining 30-40\% of thalamic cells discharged
	rhythmic (1-4 Hz) spike bursts during periods of EEG silence. This
	rhythm, within the frequency range of delta waves, is generated in
	thalamic cells by the interplay between two of their intrinsic currents
	at critical levels of Vm hyperpolarization. However, with the deepening
	of burst-suppression, when silent EEG periods became longer than
	30 sec, thalamic cells also ceased firing. The assumption that full-blown
	burst-suppression is achieved through virtually complete disconnection
	in brain circuits implicated in the genesis of the EEG is corroborated
	by the revival of normal cellular and EEG activities after volleys
	setting into action thalamic and cortical networks.},
