# Burst-Suppression-Model
This repo contains some course code of my published paper:

Homeostatic dynamics, hysteresis and synchronization in a low-dimensional model of burst suppression.

Burst suppression is an inactivated brain state in which the electroencephalogram is characterized by in- termittent periods
of isoelectric quiescence. 

Here, we develop a mean-field model for neuronal activity with metabolic homeostatic mechanisms.
